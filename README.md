# 🌱 Composting Digital Twin ♻️  
### A Physics-Inspired Compost Simulation Model

> A software-first digital twin that models composting dynamics using environmental response functions and microbial activity equations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Composting Digital Twin** is a mathematical simulation of the composting process.  
It models how environmental conditions influence microbial activity, which in turn drives organic waste degradation.

This is a pure simulation model — no hardware required.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

The system is built around three scientific mechanisms:

### 1️⃣ Environmental Response Function
Microbial efficiency depends on:
- 🌡 Temperature  
- 💧 Moisture  

Modeled using Gaussian response curves.

---

### 2️⃣ Microbial Growth (Logistic-Inspired)
Microbial activity increases gradually under optimal conditions and stabilizes over time.

---

### 3️⃣ Biomass Degradation
Organic mass decreases proportionally to microbial activity.
